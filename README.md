# hello-world
Just another day learning Github
I am BigChungus.
I know what most of you are thinking about my name but I swear it wasnt the reason I picked this name. It was just funny and I like bugs bunny.
I dont know shit about coding but still trying to learn. I hope I am able to learn it before completing my Mining engineering. Otherwise i will have to work in undergroound mines with no life at all.
